# Project Title
Fantasy Football Data Snatcher
Allow for a faster and more efficient way to take data from fantasy football websites to excel files to later be analysed. 
Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description
During my statistics class earlier this school year we were tasked with a project to create graphs and analyze data on a topic of our choice. During the time when this project was introduced I was still working on that project. During my data collection it became a waste of time to have to copy and paste and reformat the gathered information into a structure which was uable. I wanted to create a solution for this problem and have worked to create a sceen scraper to bring the new data after each week to the excel spreadsheet ready to be analyzied by the user with the use of graph and other charts to make accurate player predictions.

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
